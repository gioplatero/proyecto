        <h1> DIET TO GAIN WEIGHT</h1>
        
              <h3>HOW I KNOW IF I AM UNDERWEIGHT?</h3>
            <p><br />
To evaluate a person´s weight, it makes at the same way as where there is overweight. First of all, the BMI or Body Mass Index, gave us a first reference. It is considerated as underweight, when it is less than 18.5.
A diet with the purpouse of gain weight, should be hypecaloric, or what is the same, it should be planned a caloric consumption bigger than the caloric burning of the person.<br />
            <br />

One of the main problems of people who wants to gain weight by themselves, is that they make it eating in a bad way, for example, choosing very caloric dishes like fried food or sugary products. In our nutritional platform, we always face these type of diet since a healthy point through balance diets.<br />
<br />
                </p>
<h3>SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE TYPE OF FOOD TO CONSUME TO GAIN WEIGHT?</h3>
        <p>
<br />
We always must adapt diets to a single person, based on his or her tastes, energetic consumption, and specific facts about his or her health.

Some type of food that is generally recommended is:

Fresh fruits
Dried fruits
Nuts
Extra virgin olive oil
refined cereals (Bread, pasta, rice)
<br />
<br />
            </p>
<h3>NUMBER OF FOODS PER DAY?</h3>
        <p>
<br />
A common caracteristic between underweighted people, is that they usually satiate easily and have a fast metabolism that burn more calories than usual. The best way to solve this situation, is planning small food times with a little space of time between them. 
A recommendation would be planning a minimun of 6 food times per day.<br />
