            <h1>Allergy to Crustaceans and Molluscs</h1>
            <p>
                <br />
              
Seafood is one of the foods that causes the most allergies. Shellfish allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction of the immune mechanism (mediated by IgE).<br />
                <br />
Symptoms begin with oral allergy syndrome, with itching of the palate, larynx and sometimes the ear; angioedema (swelling of the lip) and digestive, cardiovascular and even anaphylactic shock symptoms may occur.<br />
                <br />
As mentioned above, those allergic to shellfish may react to fish but no cross-reactivity between the two has been demonstrated.<br />
                <br />
                </p>

                Dust mites have a protein similar to crustaceans (tropomyosin), so if you are allergic to dust mites, you have a higher risk of suffering from allergy to shellfish (up to 80%) or to anisakis or even cockroaches. This phenomenon is called cross-sensitivity.<br />
                <br />
If you have asthma or hives, it is important to rule out exacerbations when you cook seafood at home (even if you do not eat it), when you enter a fish market, or in a bar/restaurant where seafood is being cooked, etc.<br />
                <br />

<h3>Foods to avoid if you are allergic to shellfish</h3><br />
                <br />
            <p>
Avoid foods that have been fried in oil in which shellfish have been previously cooked or that have been cooked in containers or handled with utensils previously used in shellfish processing.
It is recommended that you limit the consumption of industrial foods as much as possible and that you read the label carefully, as shellfish is found in many foods (soups, pizzas, paella, frozen crab rolls, salads, etc.).
You should always carry your adrenaline pen, because there can often be traces of shellfish on a plate or in a cooking instrument (grill, pan...) and suffer an outbreak caused by hidden allergens or vapours.<br />
