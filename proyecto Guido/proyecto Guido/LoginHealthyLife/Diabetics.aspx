Diets for diabetics.</h3>
            <p>
               
If you have diabetes, your body cannot produce or use insulin properly. This leads to high levels of glucose (sugar) levels. A healthy eating helps to keep blood sugar at a good level. It is a key part of managing diabetes. Controlling blood sugar (glucose) can prevent complications of diabetes.<br />
                <br />
Healthy eating for a diabetic includes<br />
                <br />

- Limit foods that are high in sugar<br />
                <br />
- Eating small portions throughout the day<br />
                <br />
- Pay attention to when and how much carbohydrate you eat<br />
                <br />
- Eat a wide variety of whole foods, fruits and vegetables<br />
                <br />
- Consume less fat<br />
                <br />
- Limit alcohol consumption<br />
                <br />
- Reduce the quantity of salt used in foods<br />

The road to a better health<br />
                <br />
Eating well is one of the main things you can do to help to control diabetes.<br />
                <br />
Do I have to follow a special diet?<br />
                <br />
There is no "diabetes-specific diet". Your doctor can work with you to design an eating plan. An eating plan is a guide that tells you what kinds of foods you can eat at meals and snacks. The plan also tells you how much food you should eat. For most people who have diabetes (and those who don't, too), a healthy diet is:<br />
                <br />
- 40% to 60% of calories are from carbohydrates.<br />
                <br />
- 20% of calories are from protein<br />
                <br />
- 30% or less of calories are from fat<br />
                <br />
Your diet should also be low in cholesterol, low in salt and low in added sugar.<br />
                <br />
Can I consume some quantity of sugar ?<br />
                <br />
Yes. In the last years, doctors have found that eating a little sugar doesn't usually cause problems for most people who have diabetes, as long as it's part of a balanced diet. Just be careful about how much sugar do you eat but try not to add sugar to your foods.<br />
                <br />
What kinds of foods can I eat ?<br />
                <br />
In general, per each meal you should eat:<br />
                <br />
- 2 to 5 choices (or up to 60 grams) of carbohydrates<br />
                <br />
- 1 choice of protein.<br />
                <br />
- A certain amount of fat.<br />
                <br />
Talk to your doctor or nutritionist for specific advice.<br />
                <br />
- <strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Carbohydrates are found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, dairy products, and starchy foods such as bread. Try to eat fresh fruit instead of canned fruit, fruit juice, or dried fruit. You can eat fresh vegetables and frozen or canned vegetables. Condiments such as fat-free mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard are also carbohydrates.<br />
                <br />
- <strong>Protein:</strong> Protein is found in meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, beans, and some vegetables. Try to eat chicken and fish more often than red meat. Do not eat the skin of poultry. Also, trim extra fat from all meat. Choose fat-free or low-fat options when eating dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt.<br />
                <br />
- <strong>Fat:</strong> Butter, margarine, lard, and oils add fat to foods. Fat is also in many dairy and meat products. Try to avoid fried foods, mayonnaise-based dishes (unless they are made with fat-free mayonnaise), egg yolks, bacon, and high-fat dairy products. Your doctor or nutritionist will tell you how many grams of fat you can eat per day. When eating the fat-free versions of foods (such as mayonnaise and butter), check the label to see how many grams of carbohydrates they contain. Keep in mind that these products usually have sugar added.<br />
