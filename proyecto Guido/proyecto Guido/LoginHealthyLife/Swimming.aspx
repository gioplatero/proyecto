            <h2>Diets for athletes in terms of swimming </h2>
        
        <p>
            Swimming is a widely practiced sport because it adapts easily to the physical form of the athlete.
            Professional swimmers should pay great attention to their nutritional planning, to improve their marks
            and boost your speed and endurance.
            <br />
            <br />
       
           The swimming tests have a variable duration, from the shortest 2 minutes,
            up to 40 minutes the longest. There are individual and relay events and can be classified:
             <br />
           
        -Sprints: 50-100 m
             <br />
            
        -Average race: 200-400 m
             <br />
            
        -Long race: 800-1500 m
             <br />
          
        -Relays: 4 × 100 free style, 4 × 100 styles, 4 × 200 free style.
         <br />
            <br />
         Feeding and training are key to a swimmer's success.
            As the workouts are usually long, intense and both in the water and in the earth,
            the diet for swimmers should be planned in a personalized way,
            depending on the time of the season that the athlete is involved.
            Keep in mind that in times of competition you can swim several series on the same day.</p>

        <h3>Nutrition of a swimmer</h3><br />

        <p>The swimmers diet aims to improve aerobic endurance and physical condition.
           Depending on the swimmer's style, it will also be necessary to work power and explosive strength in short distances.</p>
        
          <div></div>

        <h3>Carbohydrates</h3><br />

        <p>As carbohydrates are the main fuel, you must consume them in sufficient quantities,
            well distributed and preferably those with a lower glycemic index 
            <strong>(pasta, bread, rice - better whole grains -, new potatoes, quinoa, legumes, vegetables, fruit, ...).</strong>
             <br />
            <br />
        Avoid simple carbohydrates from refined flours or sugars because they activate insulin,
            fat storage and inflammation thereby increasing the risk of injury.
             <br />
            <br />
        If you train 1 hour a day you should ingest: 5-6 g HC / Kg / day.
            Increase to 7-9 g / Kg / day in times when you train more than 2 hours a day.
             <br />
            <br />
        If your workouts are interval resistance,
            Eat 2 hours before training and if you are going to do double training or do a longer session, 
            you can consume 30-60 g HC / hour through a gel or sports drink that you can take in the transition
            from dry to wet or vice versa.</p>

          <div></div>

        <h3>Proteins</h3>

        <p>Proteins are essential for repairing muscle damage and improving power.
            You must ingest 1.2-1.4 g / Kg / day of proteins of high biological value to
            from legumes, fish, eggs, poultry, meat, dairy, etc...
             <br />
            <br />
        After intense training or competition, it is important to accompany your protein intake with food
           that provide energy (CH) to ensure protein balance, promote growth,
           muscle repair and adaptation. It is estimated that 10 g of protein would be enough
           <strong>(2 small eggs, 300 ml milk, 35 g milk powder, 30 g cheese, 200 g yogurt, 35-50 g meat or fish,
           150 g cooked legumes, 200 g green beans, 100 g bread, 90-120 g cereals, 2 cups cooked pasta,
            3 cups of rice, 60 g of nuts, 400 ml of soy milk, 120 g of tofu).</strong></p>
        
          <div></div>

        <h3>Fats</h3>
        <p>You must increase the intake of monounsaturated fats (olive oil, avocado)
           and polyunsaturated (blue fish, nuts, seeds),
           to avoid the tendency to accumulate Kcal in the form of fat and improve aerobic endurance.
             <br />
            <br />
       It is very important to ensure a good night's rest in order to perform at your best on race day.</p>

        <div></div>

        <h3>Swimmers hydration</h3>
        <p>You should get into a habit of drinking even if you don't feel thirsty.
           It is a common mistake to think that being in the pool does not dehydrate you.
           Hydrate before, during and after training,
           with water and sports drinks to compensate for water, glycogen and mineral losses.</p>

        <div></div>

        <h3> Diet for swimmers  </h3>

        <p>Nutrition planning in your diet for swimmers<strong> It's very important.</strong>
            What you eat is just as important as when you eat it. Never exercise with an empty stomach.
            Try to eat 5 meals a day. Includes lean protein and favorable fat at every meal,
            according to the rule of the plate.
             <br />
            <br />
       Consume foods rich in fiber, fried and fat in moderation in your diet for swimmers,
           as they are digested slowly and can create a feeling of heaviness or indigestion during the test.
             <br />
            <br />
        Snacks are very important to restore glycogen and provide amino acids to repair tissues,
           follow the examples in the following infographic:</p>

        <p>If you are a teenage swimmer it is very important that you plan your diet with a
            <strong>Sports Nutritionist</strong> to avoid energy deficiencies
            and nutrients that can affect growth or defenses.</p>

        <div></div>

        <h3>Diet on the day of a competition</h3>

        <p>Do not try any food that you have not previously tried.
            Avoid fried, spicy, salty foods or very fatty preparations
            or high in fiber to prevent possible diarrhea or gastrointestinal upset.
             <br />
            <br />
        Eat breakfast 2 to 3 hours before the test to replenish glycogen stores
            and drink 2 glasses of water an hour before the start.
            The recommended carbohydrate ration is 3-5 g / Kg.
             <br />
            <br />
        If you are going to swim several heats on the same day, if you have 3 hours between the two you can have pasta,
            fish and fruit, but if you have less than two hours,
            eat foods that are easier to digest such as low-fat yogurt, fresh cheese, and fruit.
            If the tests are only one hour apart, you can only hydrate with a sports drink at
            glucose / fructose base.</p>

        <div></div>

        <h3>Travel diet for swimmers</h3>

        <p>Normally in hotels there is usually a lot of offer,
           but to guarantee snacks and breakfast on the day of the test you can bring fruit,
            &nbsp; nuts, lean cold cuts, to guarantee the optimal supply of energy and nutrients.</p>
