            <h1>Lipids</h1>

            <p>
Are a group of biologic molecules which shares two characteristics: are water unsolvable and rich in energy by the number of carbon-hydrogen links. Two main types of lipids in blood are: choresterol and tryglycerides colesterol. The lipids purpose in human body are vital to energy storage and development of the plasmatic membrane. 
            If lipid levels are too high, it can accumulate in arterial walls until form a plate which could obstruct blood´s road. <br /> 
                </p>
<h2>Main types of lipids which are in live organisms:</h2> 
<br />
<h3>1. Phospholipids:</h3> 
            <p>

Are two chains of fatty acids, a phosphate group and a glycerol group. Contain molecules which attracts and repels water, taking an important role in celular membranes constitution. There are so much types of phospholipids in human body, specially in the brain. In the body there are much forms which it involves in flat digestion in small intestine. <br />
</p>
<br />
<h3>2. Glicolipids</h3> 
            <p>
Glicolipids are flat molecules which contains a sugar unit, such as glucose or galactose. Short sugar chains forms glicolipids, which can be found in the exoplasmatic surface of a celular membrane. Them take an important role in the body inmune system development. <br />
</p>
<br />
<h3>3. Choresterol:</h3>  
            <p>
Chroresterol its found in cells and in human beings blood torrent. Becuase it is no solvable in blood, it must be transported to cells with the help of lipoproteins. Despite that too much choresterol could be harmful for human body, choresterol is an important molecule. It is neccesary to form celular membranes and is the precursor of another steroids, such testosterone and estradiol. <br />
</p>
<br />
<h3>4. Triglycerids:</h3> 
<p>Tryglicerid molecules are made of three fatty acid molecules and a glicerol molecule. Fat can be satured or unsatured. A triglycerid can be classified as fat if it solidify at a temperature of 20ºC, in another case, it would be classified as oils.
Tryglicerids are important for storage of human body´s energy. Are obtained from fatty food resources, ktchen oils, butter and animal fat.
It take an important role in how human body use vitamins. Where there are no burned all the calories consumed, them turns to triglycerids and are stored to a future use. If you consume more calories than you burn or eat too much fatty food, your tiglycerids level can be too high and produce a healthy risk.
