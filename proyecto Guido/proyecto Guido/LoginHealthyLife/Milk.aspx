                <br />
Cow's milk allergy is an adverse reaction of the immune system that manifests itself with gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting, diarrhoea), skin reaction (atopic dermatitis or urticaria) and in more severe cases can lead to anaphylaxis.<br />
                <br />
The main allergenic proteins in milk are alpha S1-casein and beta-lacto-globulin. Casein is used in the production of other foods such as pork products (cured ham, sausages, salamis, etc.), unfermented grape must, tigernut milk, fruit juices, natural alcoholic drinks, champagne, etc.<br />
