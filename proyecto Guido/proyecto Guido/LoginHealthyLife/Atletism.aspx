         <h2> Athletics diets</h2>
        
        <p>
            Athletics includes a wide variety of events with different requirements: technique, strength, power, speed and endurance. 
            Each athlete is different and their nutritional needs vary depending on their biomechanical and psychological character
            istics and the time of the season.</p>
       
         <h3>Nutrition in athletics</h3>
        
        <p>This will depend on the area of the athletics in which you are focused.</p>

         <p><strong>The diet for endurance athletes (distance, walking, half marathon and marathon)</strong>, aims to improve aerobic endurance and physical condition.
             To do this, body composition must be optimized and the percentage of body fat adjusted, to maximize the athlete&#39;s performance without the risk of a nutritional
             deficit. Prevention of dehydration and carbohydrate replacement are performance limiting factors. The consumption of proteins associated 
             with CH after a resistance session encourages adaptation to training.</p>

         <p><strong>Medium-distance athletes -800m-3000m- and competing in jumps</strong>, require a unique combination of speed, strength and endurance. 
             They tend to train in periods with a dynamic progression in volume, duration, and intensity. The carbohydrate supply should be
             adjusted to your requirements and to the time of the season. A mid-distance runner can use more muscle glycogen in an intense
             30-minute session (20 sets of 200m with short recovery spaces) than a marathon runner in a 2-hour session. It is very important
             to monitor iron levels in these athletes as it determines their aerobic capacity (VO2max).</p>

         <p><strong>For athletes competing in speed events, jumps, throws and combined events,</strong> the diet should facilitate the anaerobic moments or
             phases of the sessions, both lactic and alactic, to maintain the necessary strength, power and flexibility and adequate recovery
             capacity. The excessive consumption of proteins (&gt; 1.8 g / kg / day) does not seem advantageous according to the latest consensus.
             The key is to provide high-quality protein associated with carbohydrates right after workouts.)</p>

        <p>Avoid <strong>simple carbohydrates</strong> that come from refined flours or sugars because
            <strong> they activate insulin</strong>, fat storage and inflammation, this increasing the risk of injury.</p>

          <div></div>

        <h3>Athletics diet:</h3><br />

        <p><strong>Healthy meals / snacks to maintain optimal nutrition for an athlete are:</strong></p>

        <p> fruits like kiwi, apple, avocado and tangerines after each meal. </p>
        <p> nuts such as cashews, almonds and hazelnuts (no more than 3 a day) </p>
        <p> and light ham and cheese sandwiches </p>
          <div></div>

        <h3>What to eat after a competition?</h3><br />

        <p> After intense training or competition, it is important to accompany the protein intake with foods that provide energy (CH)
             to ensure protein balance, promote muscle growth, repair and adaptation. It is estimated that with 10 g of protein it would be
             enough (2 small eggs, 300 ml milk, 35 g milk powder, 30 g cheese, 200 g yogurt, 35-50 g meat or fish, 150 g legumes
             cooked, 200 g green beans, 100 g bread, 90-120 g cereals, 2 cups cooked pasta, 3 cups of rice, 60 g nuts, 400 ml soy milk,
             120 g tofu).</p>

        <p>The first 60 minutes are very important for muscle recovery since
             This is when the highest assimilation of nutrients is achieved.
             The recovery diet depends on individual physical goals:</p>

    
         <h3>Importance of hydration in athletics</h3>

        <p>Like the rest of endurance athletes, you must acquire a habit of drinking even if you do not feel thirsty.
             Take into account the environment in which your training sessions and / or your competitions take place. At higher temperature and
             environmental humidity, greater losses of water and electrolytes.</p>

        <p>To check your losses, you can weigh yourself before and after an intense workout or long test so that you can better adjust your fluid intake
             and avoid possible states of dehydration, which would reduce your resistance. Ideally, the weight change should be less than 1% after
             exercise, for example if you weigh 65 kg, that you do not lose more than 650 g. Losses greater than 2% imply a significantly lower return.
             Select sports drinks with carbohydrates, for workouts or tests of more than one hour, to replenish electrolytes and retain hydration more effectively.</p>
