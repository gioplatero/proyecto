             <h2> Diets for athletes regarding Basket </h2>
        
        <p>
            Although basketball is a team sport, performance depends so much on group work
            <strong>(integration and interaction with other colleagues)</strong>
            as well as the individual qualities of the athlete.
            <br />
            <br />
        
           The nutritional requirements of the players depend on their position.
            The duration of a basketball game according to IBF
            <strong>(International Basketball Federation),</strong> it is four periods of 10 minutes each.
            <br />
            <br />
        Basketball players have to give the maximum in speed,
            strength, power, endurance and agility both in games and in specific training sessions.
           This game features a fast pace, a lot of skill and high intensity efforts,
            with variable payback periods,
            placing considerable demands on both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems.
            <br />
            <br />
        For this reason, basketball is considered a sport of mixed metabolic demand:
            the hour and a half game is considered aerobic work with interspersed periods
            of anaerobic actions.</p>
       
        <h3>Feeding in basket</h3>
        <p>
         You must consume enough carbohydrates and electrolytes before, during and after
            of matches / training to enhance performance and endurance.
            <br />
            <br />
        Try to eat at least three to four hours before a game,
            to increase energy reserves.
            Eat low glycemic carbohydrates such as<strong> oats, brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat pasta, artisan bread,</strong>
            to maximize your performance.
            Include lean protein and favorable fat in that meal, based on the plate rule.
            <br />
            <br />
       Avoid the<strong>simple carbohydrates</strong> qthat come from refined flours or sugars
            becouse <strong>those activate insulin</strong>, fat storage and inflammation
            thus increasing the risk of injury.</p>

        <h3>Basketball diet</h3><br />

        <h3>How to regain strength during sports practice?</h3><br />

        <p><br />
            The basketball diet has to consider that it is a discipline
              in which it is difficult to recharge hydrates when on the track.
            An effective strategy is to have a sports drink with fructose at breaks,
            to maintain performance until the end of the match.<br /></p>
        
          <div></div>

        <h3>What to eat after a basketball game?</h3><br />

        <p>For a fast and effective recovery you must recharge the glycogen stores,
            promote muscle growth, repair, and rehydrate.
            <br />
            <br />
        The first 60 minutes are very important for muscle recovery since
            This is when the highest assimilation of nutrients is achieved.
            The recovery diet depends on individual physical goals:
            <br />
            <br />
        – If the goal is to increase muscle size and strength,
            choose foods with high caloric density as a sandwich
            <strong>(cheese, ham, tuna, chicken, egg)</strong>, fruit salad with yogurt, rice pudding semi,
            Cereal bars <strong>(it is preferable that they also provide proteins)</strong> 
            or liquid recovery supplements.
            <br />
            <br />
        -If the goal is to reduce weight and body fat percentage,
            Your Sports Nutritionist should adjust the basketball diet with calorie restriction criteria.
            An example of a post-training or competition snack would be a piece of seasonal fruit,
             slices of lean cold cuts and 2 walnuts. 
            See the infographic for other snack options for athlete:</p>

        <h3>Importance of hydration in basketball</h3>

        <p>Hydration is very important, changes usually occur during intense sports practice
            in body weight, caused mainly by loss of water in the form of sweat and breathing.
            <br />
            <br />
        The two hours before the game you should drink fluids to compensate for any subsequent losses.
            It is also important to drink during the game distributed every 20-30 min.
            It is convenient to take advantage of the time you remain on the bench to replace fluids.
            <br />
            <br />
        Post-exercise hydration is very important to ensure rapid rehydration.
            You can prepare your own isotonic drink at home, to replenish electrolytes and glycogen stores.
            In the hydration post we give you the instructions for its preparation. You can prepare your own isotonic drink at home, to replenish electrolytes and glycogen stores.
