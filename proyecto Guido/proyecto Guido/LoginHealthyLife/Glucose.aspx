             <h1>Glucose</h1>  
        <p>             
Glucose is the main energy resource needed to ensure the correct funcitionality of organism cells. These need energy to be active, keep vital functionalities (heart beat, digestive movements, breathing...), body temperature and muscular movements. Somehow, it can be say that glucose is like fuel to human body, because it provides enough energy to develop daily activities normally. <br />
<br />
Since a nutritional point of view, is a simple structure sugar (monosaccharides) that enters to organism through food. During digestive procedure, its set in motion a chemical transformations chain, through digestive tube, which transforms food into smaller substances, nutrients, and these at the same time are descomposed in even smaller elements. For example , foods rich in carbohydrates are transformed in glucose, which is their simplest component.

        <h2>How its Glucose processed by human body?</h2>
        <p>
        Our body proccess glucose ideally several times per day.

When we eat, human body starts to work inmediately to proccess glucose. Enzymes start the descomposition procedure in cooperation with pancreas. Pancreas produce hormones such as insuline, which is an integral part of how our body treats glucose. <br /> When we eat, people inform pancreas that needs to release insuline to treat the increased blood sugar level.

However, some people cannot trust that his or her pancreas would appear to make the job that its supposed to do.

        <h2>How Glucose can be examined?</h2>
            <p>
Examine glucose levels is essentially important for diabetic people. Most of diabetic people are used to do blood sugar levels test as part of their daily routine.

One of most common ways to examine glucose in house is through a very simple blood test. Is about a puncture in the finger, which is usually made with a small needle called lancet and produce a drop which is placed in the probationary strap. The strap is placed in a meter, which measure blood sugar levels. Usually this can provide you a measurement in less than 20 seconds.
