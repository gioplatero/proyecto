        <h1>Carbohydrates</h1>
        <p>
Also known as carbon hydrates, are the sugars, fibers and food starch that are in a high quantity of foods, such as fruits, grains, vegetables and milk products. The carbohydrates are one of the basic food groups which are important to keep a healthylife.
Are macronutrients, which means that are one of the three main sustances used by human body to obtain energy or calories. 
All macronutrients must be obtained from diet; the human body cannot produce them by itself.
All carbohydrates provide glucose to human body, whcih it transforms in energy, which, at the same time, its used to keep corporal functions and physical activity.
The quality of carbohydrates is important.
The most healthy carbohyrates resources are the non processed or which are a minimun processed like whole grains, vegetables, fruits and grains.
Las fuentes menos saludables incluyen pan blanco, pasteles, refrescos azucarados y otros alimentos altamente procesados o refinados.

<strong>There are two types of main carbohydrates:</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Sugar:</strong> Is the simpliest form of carbohydrates. It are produced in a natural way in some foods, including fruits, vegetables, milk and milk products. Sugars include fruit´s sugar (fructose), table´s sugar (sucrose) and milk´s sugar (lactose). <br />
<strong>Fiber:</strong> Fiber is also a complex carbohydrate, it is produced in a natural way in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, baked beans and peas. <br />
<br />
<strong>Carbohydrates Function:</strong> <br /> 
<br />
Carbohydrates provide the fuel for the central nervous system and most of muscles. Also avoid that proteins would be used as an energy resource and allow grass metabolism. <br />
        </p>

        
<strong>Carbohydrates benefits:</strong> <br />
<br />
<h3>Disease Protection:</h3> <br />
        <p>
Evidences suggest that whole grains and dietetic fiber from whole foods help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Fiber also help to avoid obesity and diabetes type 2, this is essential for an optimum digestive health. <br />
            </p>
<br />
<h3>Lostweight:</h3> <br />
        <p>
Evidence shows that eat lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grains can help to control weight.
Its most fiber content helps to feel satisfied with less calories consumption.
Good carbohydrates contain fiber. It is hard to get enough fiber in a low carbohydrates diet.
Dietetic fiber helps to feel satisfied, and normally, it comes with low calory foods. <br />
            </p>
<br />
<h3>Carbohydrates Deficience:</h3> <br />
        <p>
Do not consume enough carbohydrates can cause problems. Without enough fuel, the body do not receive energy.
Also, without enough glucose, the central nervous system suffers, which could lead to dizziness or physical and mental weakness. A glucose deficiency its called an hypoglycemia.
If the human body do not have an enough carboydrates ingest, it will consume proteins as an energy resource.
This is problematic because human body needs protein to mantain muscles.
The use of protein as an energy resource instead of carbohydrates produces tension in kidneys, by the subproducts of proteins metabolism which are eliminated by the urine. People who do not consume enough carbohydrates sldo could suffer by fibers failure, which could cause digestive problems and constipation.
