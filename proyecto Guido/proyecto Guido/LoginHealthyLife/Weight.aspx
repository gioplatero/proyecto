        <h1>DIET FOR OBESITY</h1>
        <p>The Obesity is considerated as the excess of Weight as a consequence of the increase of body fat. It is considerated that a person has obesity when his o her body mass index is more than 30 kg/m².<br /> 
            <br />
            It´s important to clarify that obesity should be treatened as a chronic disease and it´s treatment should be planned to the long term.<br />

The main objective is to make a change in lifestyle, wich would allows a gradual descent of mass, body fat and to achieve a balance of weight throughout time.
</p>
<h3>Small changes, Big results</h3>
            <p>
First of all, the person must change his or her nutritional habits:<br />
<br />
Introduce hight quantities of raw and cooked fruits and vegetables(almost five of them per day), skimmed dairy products, and whole grian cereals.<br />
<br />
                </p>
<h3>Choose meat and fish lean cuts.</h3>
        <p>Cook them with low fat receipes (baked, grilled, steamed, papillote, etc.)
Put special attention to ingredient´s quantities and try to decrease little by little salt and alcohol consumption.<br />
<br />
Drink almost between 1.5 y 2 liters of water per day.<br />
<br />
Make a complete breakfast, the person must have planned before the menus, and distribution of food times in, at least, five times to avoid practicing small food times with other type of food.<br />
<br />
Despite of this, if we make only very few changes to nutritional habits, it would be more difficult to achieve the objetive. Is very important to make these nutritional changes, and, in addition, make a gradual increase of diary physical exercises. It´s not about to become an atlete inmmediatly, and also is not about making exercises with an intensity that the person could not manage throughtout time. 
            Instead of this, the best option is choosing an exercise routine that the person could manage and include in his or her personal routine, in the way to mantain this exercise routines every day. For example, walking to job, to school or to the supermarket; 
            get off the train or bus a little bit more far of destination than usual and go walking until arrive to the place; park the car more far of the entrance than usual; replace the elevator by stairs; go out to walk; ride a bycicle, etc.

        <h2>
For all these reasons, it is useless to follow a fashion or miraculous diet that achieves a fast weightloss, throught sacrificing mass muscle and water consumption, these because of their unreal characteristics, these kind of diets could not be maintained throughtout time.
