            <h1>Peanut Allergy Diet</h1>

            <p>
            <br />
            Nut allergy is an immune system reaction of hypersensitivity mediated by IgE antibodies. Peanut and hazelnut allergy are the most common, although peanuts actually belong to the leguminous crops.<br />
                <br />
It is classified as a nut because of its oil content and because those allergic to peanuts have similar allergic reactions to those allergic to walnuts or cashews.<br />
                <br />
Nuts are considered to be the group of seeds that are consumed dried, the most consumed in Spain are listed in the following table. The coconut is not a fruit, it is the largest nut and therefore in a diet for nut allergy its sensitivity must be monitored.<br />
